This post is hard for me to write. I feel like I have a million emotions and not enough words to express myself… but I’m going to try.

I’ve recently  set off on a new adventure and took on a new role outside of a place and team that I know and love - my team at CoverMyMeds.
I was scared, nervous, excited, happy … all of the emotions.

CoverMyMeds has, without a doubt, been my best place to grow. I know that might sound cliche’ because it’s sort of been our tagline for the last few years, but I honestly mean it. That growth hasn’t been easy. If it was, I probably wouldn’t *really* have been growing. I’ve served on multiple teams and in multiple roles, stretching into roles that were beyond my comfort zone. These ultimately made me a better engineer, a better friend, a better husband and father - a better human.

The growth I experienced was exactly the kind I needed: non-linear, never focused on vertical trajectory, and always with the support of those around me. It's been growth that's been defined by me and guided by the connections I made with so many amazing people.

Everyone at CoverMyMeds has been like family. I’ve shared both laughter and tears. We've put our whole hearts into everything we've taken on and for that, I’m forever grateful.

So… Why? Why did I decide to embark on something new? Why now?

Well - I’m very lucky, very blessed, and very grateful to have had an opportunity put in front of me that feels like a leap of faith but also feels like it will teach me how to grow even more.

On June 21st, I joined a team with a founder and leadership team that I know and trust in the early stages of finding product-market fit for making root-cause medicine an accessible and mainstream part of healthcare. 

When presented with an opportunity to join this team, I knew in both my head and heart that this was the next step I needed to take in my personal journey of growth and development. This will be (and already is) an experience unlike any I’ve had before and it aligns with my long term dream of having my own very small and altruistic company one day.

I’ll miss my team at CoverMyMeds and I am forever grateful for everything that this team has has taught me and how they’ve all helped me grow. I wish everyone continued success and growth and will continue to cheer them on.

As emotional as this has all been, I'm excited for the future. 

I'm excited for the adventure ahead. 

I’m looking forward to continued growth and to building amazing things that make an impact on this world in the most positive ways possible ♥️
